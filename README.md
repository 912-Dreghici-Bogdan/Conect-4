# Connect 4 Game ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¡

Welcome to Connect 4 - the classic game of strategy and skill, now brought to life with Python and Pygame magic!

## How to Play
Connect Four pits two players against each other in a battle of wits and strategy. Each player takes turns dropping their colored discs into the grid, aiming to be the first to connect four of their own discs either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Controls
- **Player 1**: Left click to drop your disc into the column of your choice.
- **Player 2 (AI)**: Watch as the AI cunningly calculates its move, thanks to the powerful Minimax algorithm.

## Game Over
The game ends when one player successfully connects four discs in a row, or when the board fills up completely, resulting in a stalemate.

## What Makes it Tick
Behind the scenes, the game is powered by Python and the Pygame library. Pygame handles all the graphics and sound, making the gameplay experience truly immersive. The AI opponent utilizes the Minimax algorithm, a sophisticated decision-making process that ensures the AI makes optimal moves, keeping you on your toes throughout the game.
